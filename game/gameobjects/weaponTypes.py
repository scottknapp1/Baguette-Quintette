    # Hello! I know you're probably wondering "why does this class even exists?" and that is a fair question!
    # we were actually meant to have multiple guns when we first pitched the game, but the idea got later on
    # scrapped as it would break the feeling of the game.
    # We tho plan in adding further stuff such as multiple weapons (after the deadline) so we decided to keep this here
